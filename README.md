# Cloudy-NonCloudy-SAR-Image-Classification-YOLO

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for detecting cloudy images in satellite imagery using the YOLOv8 algorithm. Clouds play a crucial role in weather and climate studies, impacting the Earth's atmospheric energy balance through the scattering and absorption of shortwave light and the absorption and reemission of infrared radiation.

## Key Features
- Utilization of YOLOv8, an advanced object detection algorithm, for cloud detection in satellite images
- Achieving high accuracy levels of 0.99 to 1, ensuring reliable and precise identification of cloudy scenes
- Implementation of Ultralytics, a powerful deep learning framework, to train and deploy the cloud detection model
- Integration of popular technologies such as Kaggle, Python, Roboflow, and OpenCV to facilitate data processing and model development

## Installation Process
1. Download the Jupyter notebook for easy code execution and experimentation.
2. Set up the notebook in Google Colab to leverage the advantages of a cloud-based development environment.
3. Download the dataset containing satellite images to train and test the cloud detection model.
4. Install the necessary libraries and dependencies required for running the notebook, ensuring smooth execution of the code.

## Contributions
- The project welcomes contributions from individuals with expertise in YOLO and OpenCV. Collaborators can contribute by enhancing the model architecture, improving detection accuracy, or optimizing code performance.
- Working with the dataset and exploring additional datasets can also contribute to the project's development.

## Limitations
- The project's limitations include the availability and size of the dataset. Working with a limited dataset may affect the model's generalization and performance on unseen data.
- The presence of high noise levels in the dataset images poses a challenge for accurate cloud detection. However, efforts can be made to preprocess the data and apply noise reduction techniques to mitigate this issue.

By leveraging the capabilities of YOLOv8 and employing advanced image processing techniques, this repository offers a robust solution for cloud detection in satellite images.
