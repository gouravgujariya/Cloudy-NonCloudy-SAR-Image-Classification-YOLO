# Cloudy-NonCloudy-SAR-Image-Classification-YOLO

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for detecting cloudy images in satellite imagery using the YOLOv8 algorithm. Clouds play a crucial role in weather and climate studies, impacting the Earth's atmospheric energy balance through the scattering and absorption of shortwave light and the absorption and reemission of infrared radiation.
